        <blockquote><em><q>Routers are used to connect both similar and dissimilar LANs. Router operates on the
                    network
                    layer
                    of OSI
                    model using the physical layer, data link layer and network layer to provide connectivity,
                    addressing
                    and
                    switching. These are highly intelligent devices. In case of TCP/IP network, Internet Protocol
                    (IP)
                    is
                    used
                    as addresses for network; this is the router which interprets the IP address and delivers the
                    packet
                    reliably.</q><cite>Autor</cite></em></blockquote>

        <p id="id3"><em>Now, we may say that router transmits the network layer data and therefore, provides
                transmission of
                data
                between LANs that use different data link protocols but using the same network layer protocol.
                Because
                of
                this, Etl1ernet can be connected with token ring network using routers. Additionally, routers
                provide
                connectivity La MAN (SMDS) and WAN (X.25, Frame Relay and ATM). Routers are protocol sensitive;
                typically
                supporting multiple protocols and large and varying packet sizes such as might be involved in
                supporting
                both Ethernet and Token Ring.</em></p>

        <p id="id4"><em>A network consisting of routers can have multiple paths unlike bridges. Normally, the
                shortest
                of
                all paths
                in the network is used to transfer packets.</em></p>

        <p id="id5"><em>Consider a case for data transmission from computer 1 to computer 5 on the network. When
                computer 1
                starts
                sending the data, it compares its IP address with computer 5, i.e. destination computer addresses to
                know
                whether computer 5 lies on its own network or not. When computer 1 finds that it is not on its
                network,
                it
                transmits a data packet containing the MAC address R of router in this case. When router receives
                this
                packet, it sets the MAC address of computer 5 and sends packet to the port which has the same IP
                destination
                address as given in data packet. In this manner computer 5 receives the data packet.</em></p>
